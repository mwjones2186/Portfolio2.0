  ## Description 

  This is my portfolio. It is a continuous work in progress. However, I am very proud of how far I have come in a short 5 months.  With that, for this application I was able to use some new libraries and technologies I have not used yet. It was a really fun project to work on and I want to continue to put time and effort into this project. .

  This is to showcase my abilities. What more motivation do I need?! This is what the whole course is building us up for. My page that I can highlight my strengths and my weaknesses. Is an opportunity to play with new languages and see how they interact. But most importantly, this is the project that houses all of my other projects. A framework that will continue to grow as I grow and morph into something completely different over time. Im excited for where it is and where it will go!.

  Its me. Its my portfolio. Its what i put together from skratch. Its a place I can add new projects, highlight new skills, demonstrate an ability of using a specific language, or multiples. It stands out because its unique. Its what I have created from nothing. .

  Rabbit holes are sometimes fun to go down....sometimes they are not...Honestly, since the middle of this program, I find myself gravitating toward backend development. I didnt really care if the box had rounded corners. If the shade of blue wasnt right. If the container wasnt perfect. I didnt realy care as long as my function worked the way it was designed. I get more satisfaction out of the code working rather than how asthetically pleasing it is. BUT...I now know that in many ways front end dev is likely your foot in the door. I really tried to find some cool libraries like MUI and framer motion to add some fun features to my project. It was as satisfying to get some of thesefront end features to work as it was to get some of my back end functions or routes to work. It lit a little fire under me for optimizing my skills with react. Im excited to see where I can take it from here!.

 

  ## Installation
  Since there is no back end, its pretty simple. 1. Clone the repo 2. in terminal run 'npm i' to download all the packages. 2A. Another option, if you have a react sandbox you work in, you can simply copy and paste the 'SRC' file from my application and paste it into your sandbox. 3.  After 'npm i' you will need to create a react app. Once the react app is complete and you have your build, in the terminal type 'npm start' This will start the application..

  ## Usage

  Its a portfolio. Use it with your projects. The file structure is pretty basic and easy to manuveur however, it could be broken down further or a backend added if someone wanted to. .

  ## Contribution

  As always, feedback is appreciated. Good, bad or ugly. I want to know my shortcomings as much as I want to hear praises. We can always get better. You could also help contribute by offering me a job! or a lead...or anything. Hahaha! A side from that, any shout out is apprecited and please friend me on LinkedIn. Thank you!.

  ## Tests

  No formal tests like JEST or anything, just lots of trial and error. .
